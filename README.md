# SafeZone: Real-time Video Analytics for Industrial Safety


SafeZone, created by Crakers Manufacturing Enterprise, utilizes Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision to analyze live video feeds from industrial sites, precisely identifying safety incidents. This advanced system represents a major stride in ensuring workplace safety.




Crakers Manufacturing enterprise Safety is crucial for selling employee protection, and stopping accidents, 
in industrial environments. SafeZone is a sophisticated real-time video analytics device designed to decorate industrial protection by using mitigating potential hazards and making sure a steady painting environment.
Using modern-day generations like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Computer Vision.SafeZone continuously monitors stay video feeds from commercial sites and identifies protection-associated incidents with excessive accuracy. 
By constantly assessing employee sports and environmental situations, SafeZone efficaciously identifies capability safety hazards, along with unauthorized personnel in restricted zones, dangerous device operations, or dangerous cloth leaks.
The device instantly indicators safety employees and applicable stakeholders to interfere and mitigate dangers promptly.SafeZone units are a brand new general for industrial protection, decreasing accidents, protecting personnel, 
and fostering more secure work surroundings inside Craker Industries. The version has been designed to discover and alert the industries. And Incorporate IoT (Internet of Things ) to take careful activities like spraying  Fire extinguishers.
